## Composable

### Total control over your Frontend.

The power of your favorite commerce backends, with the freedom of open-source frontend frameworks. From content management to URL pathnames, Vercel gives you total Frontend control.

Build with the open source frameworks and headless tools that fit your business needs.

Break free from the preset designs and inflexible templates with the latest in modern framework development.

> With our previous managed service, we were restricted to their platform, so we were restricted in what we were able to build. Going headless allowed us to keep the power of that commerce backend, and bring in the UI flexibility of Next.js.

**Total control over server, cache, and client.**Unlike monolithic or closed architectures, Vercel puts optimization decisions in the hands of the developer. You decide what makes sense for your app.

### Data from anywhere.

### Intelligently cached.

Out-of-the-box support for Pre-rendering and Partial pre-rendering, from origin cache or edge, for the fastest user.

### Optimized for everywhere.

With a reduced load on both your backend and the client, sites are performant no matter what device your user is visiting from.

### Partial prerendering.

Ultra-quick static edge delivery with fully dynamic capabilities.
