# Sending a sample of events to Speed Insights

By default, all events are sent to Speed Insights.

To send only a sample of your data, you can add the Speed Insights component with the[sampleRate](/docs/speed-insights/package#samplerate)prop to your app's root layout. The[sampleRate](/docs/speed-insights/package#samplerate)prop accepts a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%:

```jsx
import
 { SpeedInsights }
from

'@vercel/speed-insights/next'
;





export

default

function

RootLayout
({ children
,
 }
:
 {children
:

React
.
ReactNode
;}) {



return
 (



<
html lang
=
"en"
>


      <
head
>


        <
title
>
Next
.js
</
title
>



</
head
>


      <
body
>


        {children}



<
SpeedInsights sampleRate
=
{
0.5
}
/>



</
body
>



</
html
>


  );


}
```
