### Design more, configure less.

Choose your favorite framework, the rest is up to us. Framework-defined infrastructure works out-of-the-box so your team is free to focus on designing powerful user experiences.

### Design to deploy.

Turn ideas into UI by accelerating creativity with preview deployments. Share your work like it's already in production with live preview environments, then push to prod when you're ready.

### Side-by-side collaboration.

Stick comments anywhere and everywhere. With preview comments, you can streamline feedback on the actual DOM elements of the webpage in real time, on real live UI.

### Rapidly iterate with rollbacks.

Empower your teams to ship and experiment safely. Instant rollbacks with a push of a button, just in case.

### Toolkit at your fingertips.

With the Vercel Toolbar, you can run an accessibility audit, check your Open Graph image, QA for layout shifts, and view and manage your feature flags without leaving the platform.

### A deployment for every idea.

Leave no stone unturned by confidently capturing each iteration with a shareable preview deployment link.

Okay, I've flipped this to our seconddarkest color token,`-900`.

Contrast between foreground and background colors should meet WCAG 2 AA minimum contrast ratio threshold.
