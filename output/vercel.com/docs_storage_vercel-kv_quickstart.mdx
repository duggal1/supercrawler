# Redis on Vercel

Vercel lets you connect external Redis databases through the[Marketplace](/marketplace), allowing you to integrate high-performance caching and real-time data storage into your Vercel projects without managing Redis servers.

## Connecting to the Marketplace

Vercel enables you to use Redis by integrating with external database providers. By using the Marketplace, you can:

* Select a[Redis provider](/marketplace?category=storage&search=redis)(e.g. Upstash, Redis).
* Provision and configure a Redis database with minimal setup.
* Have credentials and[environment variables](/docs/environment-variables)injected into your Vercel project.
