# Deployment integration actions

With deployment integration actions, integration providers can enable[integration resource](/docs/integrations/create-integration/native-integration#resources)tasks to be performed such as branching a database, setting environment variables, and running readiness checks. It then allows integration users to configure and trigger these actions automatically during a deployment.

## How deployment actions work

1. Action declaration:An integration[product](/docs/integrations/create-integration/native-integration#resources)declares deployment actions with an ID, name, and metadata.Actions can specify configuration options that integration users can modify.Actions can include suggestions for default actions to run such as "this action should be run on previews".

1. Deployment execution:When a deployment is created, the configured actions are registered on the deployment.The registered actions trigger the`deployment.integration.action.start`webhook.If a deployment is canceled, the`deployment.integration.action.cancel`webhook is triggered.

Resource-side processing:The integration provider processes the webhook, executing the necessary resource-side actions such as creating a database branch.During the processing of these actions, the build is blocked and the deployment set in a provisioning state.Once complete, the integration provider updates the action status.

## Creating deployment actions

As an integration provider, to allow your integration users to add deployment actions to an installed native integration, follow these steps:

1. [Declare deployment actions](#declare-deployment-actions)Declare the deployment actions for your native integration product.Open the Integration Console.Select your Marketplace integration and clickManage.Edit an existing product or create a new one.Go toDeployment Actionsin the left-side menu.Create an action by assigning it a slug and a name.Next, handle webhook events and perform API actions in your[integration server](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product#deploy-the-integration-server). Review the[example marketplace integration server](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration)code repository.
1. Open the Integration Console.
1. Select your Marketplace integration and clickManage.
1. Edit an existing product or create a new one.
1. Go toDeployment Actionsin the left-side menu.
1. Create an action by assigning it a slug and a name.
1. [Handle the deployment start](#handle-the-deployment-start)Handle the`deployment.integration.action.start`webhook. This webhook triggers when a deployment starts an action.This is a webhook payload example:`{"installationId":"icfg_1234567","action":"branch","resourceId":"abc-def-1334","deployment":{"id":"dpl_568301234"}}`This payload provides IDs for the installation, action, resource, and deployment.
1. [Use the Get Deployment API](#use-the-get-deployment-api)You can retrieve additional deployment details using the[Get a deployment by ID or URL](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints#tag/deployments/get-a-deployment-by-id-or-url)endpoint:`curlhttps://api.vercel.com/v13/deployments/dpl_568301234\-H"Authorization: {access_token}"`You can create your`access_token`from[Vercel's account settings](/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token).Review the[full code](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration/blob/6d2372b8afdab36a0c7f42e1c5a4f0deb2c496c1/app/dashboard/webhook-events/actions.tsx)for handling the deployment start in the example marketplace integration server.
1. [Complete a deployment action](#complete-a-deployment-action)Once an action is processed, update its status using the[Update Deployment Integration Action](/docs/rest-api/endpoints#tag/deployments/update-deployment-integration-action)REST API endpoint.Example request to this endpoint:`PATCHhttps://api.vercel.com/v1/deployments/{deploymentId}/integrations/{installationId}/resources/{resourceId}/actions/{action}`Example request body to send that includes the resulting updated resource secrets:`{"status":"succeeded","outcomes":[{"kind":"resource-secrets","secrets":[{"name":"TOP_SECRET","value":"****"}]}]}`
1. [Handle deployment cancellation](#handle-deployment-cancellation)When a deployment is canceled, the`deployment.integration.action.cancel`webhook is triggered. You should handle this action to clean up any partially completed actions.Use the`deployment.integration.action.cleanup`webhook to clean up any persistent state linked to the deployment. It's triggered when a deployment is removed from the system.
