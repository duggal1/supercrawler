## Hydrogen v2

This directory is a brief example of a[Hydrogen v2](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen)storefront that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

### Deploy Your Own

[](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/framework-boilerplates/hydrogen-2&template=hydrogen-2)

*Live Example:[https://hydrogen-v2-template.vercel.app](https://hydrogen-v2-template.vercel.app)*

You can also deploy using the[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```
npm i
-
g vercel
vercel
```

Hydrogen is Shopify’s stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with[Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full stack web framework. This template contains a**minimal setup**of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.

[Check out Hydrogen docs](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen)[Get familiar with Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1)

### What's included

* Remix
* Hydrogen
* Oxygen
* Shopify CLI
* ESLint
* Prettier
* GraphQL generator
* Type and Java flavors
* Minimal setup of components and routes

### Environment Variables

Using Hydrogen requires a few[environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/environment-variables)to be set in order to properly connect to Shopify. For this template, the minimal set of environment variables are defined in the`vercel.json`file, which will be applied to the deployment when deployed to Vercel. However, you should migrate these default environment variables to your Project's Environment Variables configuration in the Vercel dashboard (or using the`vc env`commands), and update them according to your needs (also change the`SESSION_SECRET`to your own value). Once that is done, delete the`vercel.json`file from your project to prevent the environment variables defined there from taking precedence.

### Local development

Rename the`.env.example`file to`.env`in order for the Shopify dev server to use those environment variables during local development. If you defined/modified additional environment variables based on the section above, be sure to apply those changes in your`.env`file as well.

Then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
