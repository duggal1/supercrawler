## A Next.js Blog with a Native Authoring Experience

This starter is a statically generated blog that uses[Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)for the frontend and[Sanity](https://www.sanity.io?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nextjs-v3vercelstarter)to handle its content. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration and visual editing with live updates using[Presentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/presentation).

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this starter to kick-start a blog or learn these technologies.

| [Blog](https://nextjs-blog.sanity.build) | [Studio](https://nextjs-blog.sanity.build/studio) |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

#### Important files and folders

| File(s) | Deion |
| --- | --- |
| `sanity.config.ts` | Config file for Sanity Studio |
| `sanity.cli.ts` | Config file for Sanity CLI |
| `/app/api/draft-mode/enable/route.ts` | Serverless route for triggering Draft mode |
| `/app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx` | Where Sanity Studio is mounted |

### Configuration

#### Step 1. Set up the environment

Use the Deploy Button below. It will let you deploy the starter using[Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-sanity-example)as well as connect it to your Sanity Content Lake using[the Sanity Vercel Integration](https://www.sanity.io/docs/vercel-integration?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nextjs-v3vercelstarter).

[](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsanity-io%2Fnextjs-blog-cms-sanity-v3&repository-name=blog-nextjs-sanity&project-name=blog-nextjs-sanity&demo-title=Blog%20with%20Built-in%20Content%20Editing&demo-deion=A%20Sanity-powered%20blog%20with%20built-in%20content%20editing%20%26%20instant%20previews&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs-blog.sanity.build%2F%3Futm_source%3Dvercel%26utm_medium%3Dreferral&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuser-images.githubusercontent.com%2F81981%2F197501516-c7c8092d-0305-4abe-afb7-1e896ef7b90a.png&integration-ids=oac_hb2LITYajhRQ0i4QznmKH7gx&external-id=nextjs;template=nextjs-blog-cms-sanity-v3)

#### Step 2. Set up the project locally

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)that was created for you on your GitHub account. Once cloned, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and the Studio to your Sanity project:

```
npx vercel env pull
```

#### Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```
npm install
&&
 npm run dev
```

When you run this development server, the changes you make in your frontend and studio configuration will be applied live using hot reloading.

Your blog should be up and running on[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! You can create and edit content on[http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio).

#### Step 4. Deploy to production

To deploy your changes to production you use`git`:

```
git add
.
git
 commit
git push
```

Alternatively, you can deploy without a`git`hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```
npx vercel
--
prod
```

### Questions and Answers
