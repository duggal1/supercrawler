## About The Project

### Components:

#### Mux:

* [Direct uploads](https://docs.mux.com/docs/direct-upload)- this is an API for uploading video files from a client to create Mux Assets
* [Webhook signature verification](https://docs.mux.com/docs/webhook-security)- webhook signature verification to make sure Mux webhooks are coming from a trusted source
* [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/)- for doing HLS video playback of videos
* [Mux Data](https://docs.mux.com/docs/data)- for tracking video quality metrics.

**Slackbot moderator**. This examples allows you to configure a`SLACK_WEBHOOK_ASSET_READY`. When a new Mux asset is`ready`, an Incoming Webhook for slack will be sent. This is an example of how you might integrate a Slack channel that can be used to moderate content. The Slack message contains the asset ID, playback ID and a storyboard of thumbnails from the video.

#### NextJS:

* [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/)— dynamically changing the`refreshInterval`depending on if the client should be polling for updates or not
* [/pages/api](https://github.com/muxinc/stream.new/tree/main/)routes — a couple endpoints for making authenticated requests to the Mux API.
* Dynamic routes using[getStaticPaths  and  fallback: true](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation), as well as dynamic API routes.

This app was created with the[NextJS  with-mux-video  example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mux-video)as a starting point.

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Create an account in Mux

All you need to set this up is a[Mux account](https://mux.com). You can sign up for free and pricing is pay-as-you-go. There are no upfront charges, you get billed monthly only for what you use.

Without entering a credit card on your Mux account all videos are in “test mode” which means they are watermarked and clipped to 10 seconds. If you enter a credit card all limitations are lifted and you get \$20 of free credit. The free credit should be plenty for you to test out and play around with everything before you are charged.

### Step 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the`.env.local.example`file in this directory to`.env.local`(which will be ignored by Git):

```
cp
.
env
.
local
.
example

.
env
.
local
```

Then, go to the[settings page](https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/access-tokens)in your Mux dashboard, get a new**API Access Token**that allows for "Full Access" against Mux Video and set each variable in`.env.local`:

* `MUX_TOKEN_ID`should be the`TOKEN ID`of your new token
* `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET`should be`TOKEN SECRET`
* `MUX_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_SECRET`(optional) - the webhook signing secret if you set up webhooks (see below)
* `SLACK_WEBHOOK_ASSET_READY`(optional) - the slack webhook URL that will be used for the**Slackbot moderator**feature (see below)
* `SLACK_MODERATOR_PASSWORD`(optional) - this is the password when you want to take actions from the**Slackbot moderator**feature (see below)
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_MUX_ENV_KEY`(optional) - this is the mux environment key for Mux Data integration

### Step 3. Deploy on Vercel

You can deploy this app to the cloud with[Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example)([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

To deploy on Vercel, you need to set the environment variables using[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)([Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/secrets)).

Install the[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download), log in to your account from the CLI, and run the following commands to add the environment variables. Replace the values with the corresponding strings in`.env.local`:

```
vercel secrets add stream_new_token_id
<
MUX_TOKEN_ID
>
vercel secrets add stream_new_token_secret
<
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET
>
```

Then push the project to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and[import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example)to deploy.

### Step 4 (optional) Slackbot Moderator

This application uses a slackbot to send message to a slack channel every time a new asset is ready for playback. This requires a few steps for setup.

First, login to your Mux dashboard and in the left  igation find Settings > Webhooks. Create a new webhook and makes sure you are creating a webhook for the environment that matches the access token that you are using.

For local development you may want to use a tool[like ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)to receive webhooks on localhost. The route for the webhook handler is`/api/webhooks/mux`(defined in this NextJS app under`./pages/api/webhooks/mux`).

Create a Slack 'Incoming Webhook'. Configure the channel you want to post to, the icon, etc.

When you're done with this, you should have a slack webhook URL that looks something like`https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`.

Set the optional environment variables either directly in the vercel UI or by updating`vercel.json`and setting them as secrets for your organization. The optional environment variables are:

* `MUX_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_SECRET`- This is a security mechanism that checks the webhook signature  when the request hits your server so that your server can verify that the webhook came from Mux. Read more about[webhook signature verification](https://docs.mux.com/docs/webhook-security). Note that in`./pages/api/webhooks/mux`the code will only verify the signature if you have set a signature secret variable, so this step is optional.
* `SLACK_WEBHOOK_ASSET_READY`- This is the`https://hooks.slack.com/services/....`URL when you created the Slack Incoming Webhook.
* `SLACK_MODERATOR_PASSWORD`- This is the password that will be used to authorize deleting assets from the slack moderator (The button with the red text "DELETE (cannot be undone)")
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_MUX_ENV_KEY`- This is the env key to use with[Mux Data](https://docs.mux.com/docs/data). Note this is different than your API key and this environment key can be found on your[environment page in the Mux dashboard](https://dashboard.mux.com/environments)
* `TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`- This is an endpoint where instrumented telemetry data is sent. As of this update, the only place we collect/send telemetry data is around upload performance in order to test different configurations of[UpChunk](https://github.com/muxinc/upchunk), but there may be more in the future.

After all of this is set up the flow will be:

1. Asset is uploaded
1. Mux sends a webhook to your server (NextJS API function)
1. (optional) Your server verifies the webhook signature
1. If the webhook matches`video.asset.ready`then your server will post a message to your slack channel that has the Mux Asset ID, the Mux Playback ID, and a thumbnail of the video.

### Step 5 (optional) Add automatic content analysis to Slackbot Moderator (Google Vision API)

stream.new can automatically moderate content with the help of Google's[Cloud vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision).

Follow these steps to help moderate uploaded content:

* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`- This is a base64 encoded JSON representation of your Google service account credentials. Follow instructions below.

1. First, you will need to set up a google developer account at[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/).
1. Create a project
1. Create a service account for your project and enable the "Cloud Vision API" for your project

Export a Google Service Account authentication file in JSON format. If you have a file that is like this:

`service_account.json`

```
{

"type"
:

"service_account"
,

"project_id"
:

""
,

"private_key_id"
:

""
,

"private_key"
:
 "
--
--
-
BEGIN

PRIVATE

KEY
--
--
-
\"
,

"client_email"
:

""
,

"client_id"
:

""
,

"auth_uri"
:

""
,

"token_uri"
:

""
,

"auth_provider_x509_cert_url"
:

""
,

"client_x509_cert_url"
:

""
}
```

Get the base64 encoded string of this JSON file like so:

```
cat service
-
account
.
json

|
 base64
```

^ This command will output one long string. This string is what you will use for the ENV var`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

When the Slackbot Moderator message gets posted to slack, it will now include a "Moderation score (Google)" with 2 dimensions:

* `"adult"`
* `"suggestive"`
* `"violent"`

Each dimension will have a score from 1-5. You should interpret these scores in terms of likelihood that the video contains this type of content. This
is based on Google Vision's[Likelihood score](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.vision.v1#google.cloud.vision.v1.Likelihood)

* `1`: very unlikely
* `2`: unlikely
* `3`: possible
* `4`: likely
* `5`: very likely

### Step 6 (optional) Add automatic content analysis to Slackbot Moderator ( Hive AI )

stream.new can automatically moderate content with the help of[Hive AI](https://thehive.ai/).

Follow these steps to help moderate uploaded content:

* `HIVE_AI_KEY`- This is a base64 encoded JSON representation of your Google service account credentials. Follow instructions below.

1. First, you will need to set up an account at[thehive.ai](https://thehive.ai/).
1. Create a project
1. Get the API key for your prject

When the Slackbot Moderator message gets posted to slack, it will now include a section titled "Moderation score (hive)" with 2 dimensions:

* `"adult"`
* `"suggestive"`

Each dimension will have a score from 0-1 with a precision of 6 decimal places. These numbers come from the "Classification API" that Hive AI provides.[Details here](https://docs.thehive.ai/reference#classification).

## Hidden playback features via query params:

* `time`: will start the video at a specific timestamp in seconds, for example`?time=10`will start at 10 seconds[like this](https://stream.new/v/XQDCNm01ZPyGg81GzK4mQfL7fxFoqP8uo?time=10)
* `color`: a hex value*without*the`#`character will theme the Mux Player with the primaryColor. It's important to omit the`#`for example`?color=f97316`[like this](https://stream.new/v/XQDCNm01ZPyGg81GzK4mQfL7fxFoqP8uo?color=f97316)

## Videos to test in development:

When developing, if you make any changes to the video player, make sure it works and looks good with videos of various dimensions:

Horizontal

* http://localhost:3000/v/Hi6we01h00uVvZc00GzvVXZW8C02Y8QC8OX7

Vertical

* http://localhost:3000/v/UNDUU7tU7vYt02CRMDTlZd1qKjvk41LN6yI5LbHgtxo8

Super vertical

* http://localhost:3000/v/seK501Bf00kyqSnGdMwQFi3lgqgdoS00qm5PAiV7Yjf2ew

Also be sure to check: Safari, Mobile Safari, Chrome, Firefox because they all behave a little differently.

When the Slackbot Moderator message gets posted to slack, it will now include a section titled "Moderation score (hive)" with 2 dimensions:

* `"adult"`
* `"suggestive"`

Each dimension will have a score from 0-1 with a precision of 6 decimal places. These numbers come from the "Classification API" that Hive AI provides.[Details here](https://docs.thehive.ai/reference#classification).

## Hidden playback features via query params:

* `time`: will start the video at a specific timestamp in seconds, for example`?time=10`will start at 10 seconds[like this](https://stream.new/v/XQDCNm01ZPyGg81GzK4mQfL7fxFoqP8uo?time=10)
* `color`: a hex value*without*the`#`character will theme the Mux Player with the primaryColor. It's important to omit the`#`for example`?color=f97316`[like this](https://stream.new/v/XQDCNm01ZPyGg81GzK4mQfL7fxFoqP8uo?color=f97316)

## Videos to test in development:

When developing, if you make any changes to the video player, make sure it works and looks good with videos of various dimensions:

Horizontal

* http://localhost:3000/v/Hi6we01h00uVvZc00GzvVXZW8C02Y8QC8OX7

Vertical

* http://localhost:3000/v/UNDUU7tU7vYt02CRMDTlZd1qKjvk41LN6yI5LbHgtxo8

Super vertical

* http://localhost:3000/v/seK501Bf00kyqSnGdMwQFi3lgqgdoS00qm5PAiV7Yjf2ew

Also be sure to check: Safari, Mobile Safari, Chrome, Firefox because they all behave a little differently.
