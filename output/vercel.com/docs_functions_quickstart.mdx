# Getting started with Vercel Functions

In this guide, you'll learn how to get started with Vercel Functions using your favorite[frontend framework](/docs/frameworks)(or no framework).

## Prerequisites

* You can use an existing project or create a new one. If you don't have one, you can run the following terminal command to create a Next.js project:terminalTypeTypeJava`npx create-next-app@latest--type`

## Create a Vercel Function

Open the code block in v0 for a walk through on creating a Vercel Function with the below code, or copy the code into your project. The function fetches data from the[Vercel API](https://api.vercel.app/products)and returns it as a JSON response.

```
export

function

GET
(request
:

Request
) {



const

response

=

await

fetch
(
'https://
api
.vercel.app/products'
);



const

products

=

await

response
.json
();



return

Response
.json
(products);


}
```

[Open inOpen in v0](https://v0.dev/chat?q=
  Use the latest version of Next.js for this code: export function GET(request: Request) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/products');
  const products = await response.json();
  return Response.json(products);
}

  Create an example Next.js app using this code. In your response:
  1. Specify the type of app (e.g., blog, e-commerce, dashboard)
  2. Implement the latest Next.js version best practices including:
    - App Router
    - Server Components for improved performance
    - API Routes if needed for backend functionality
    - Proper use of Client and Server components
  3. Explain key considerations for:
    - Performance optimization (e.g., image optimization, code splitting)
    - Security best practices (e.g., input validation, CSRF protection)
    - SEO optimization
  4. Provide a modular structure for the app, including:
    - Folder structure following latest Next.js version conventions
    - Component organization
    - State management approach (if applicable)
  5. Include responsive design considerations using Tailwind CSS if applicable to the app type and export function GET(request: Request) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/products');
  const products = await response.json();
  return Response.json(products);
}
  6. Demonstrate proper error handling and loading states
  

    Additionally, as this is a quickstart guide:
    7. Teach how to implement this from scratch in a Next.js project
    8. Create a demo to walk through the implementation
    9. Provide step-by-step instructions and explanations suitable for a beginner, including:
      - Detailed project setup
      - In-depth file structure explanation
      - Comprehensive code breakdown and implementation steps
      - Any necessary configuration with explanations of each setting
    10. Include common pitfalls and how to avoid them
    11. Suggest resources for further learning on each major concept introduced
